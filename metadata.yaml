description: "Simon Called Peter is a novel by Robert Keable (1887â€“1927)  which was\
  \ a best-seller in 1921. The title is a reference to Simon Peter the apostle and\
  \ first Pope of the Catholic Church.\nIn 1921 it was met with astonishing success,\
  \ and its runaway popularity won Keable a level of celebrity. The book reportedly\
  \ sold over 600,000 copies during the 1920s, reaching a 66th edition by 1922. A\
  \ largely autobiographical work, Simon Called Peter is the tale of a priest, Peter\
  \ Graham, who has an affair in wartime France with a nurse named Julie. The title\
  \ character almost abandons his faith for love, but experiences a direct revelation\
  \ of Christ while watching a Catholic mass and is given up by his lover, who sees\
  \ his sincerity. The book was controversial at its introduction due to its sexual\
  \ and religious content;\nIt was made into a play in 1924 by Jules Eckert Goodman\
  \ and Edward Knoblock; which had a short run on Broadway.\nThis book is referred\
  \ to in The Great Gatsby. Nick Carraway, the narrator, reads a chapter and claims\
  \ that \"either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it\
  \ didn't make any sense to me.\"\nThe novel was followed by a sequel, Recompense,\
  \ published in 1924, which was made into a 1925 motion picture with the same title.\n\
